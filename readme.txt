Add Coviu video calling to your Website.

== Description ==

Coviu is a video collaboration platform.

This plugin allows you to add video collaboration functionality to your Website. This includes video conferencing as well as data conferencing, which includes image sharing, pdf sharing, shared annotations, whiteboards, shared application windows.

You will be able to add a shortcode to your Wordpress pages that creates a button to link into a video call that you own. It also provides you with a URL to share with others that can then join your video call in a Web browser. You will be notified of guests trying to join your video call and can decide to let them join or reject them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the video conferencing work? =

Coviu uses a new Web standard called WebRTC to set up video calls. This standard is currently natively supported in Chrome, Firefox and Opera browsers. Internet Edge and Safari support are in progress.

Coviu also uses Websockets to do the signalling necessary to make the video call participants aware of themselves.

The call is subsequently set up directly between all the participants. All audio, video and data flows peer-to-peer directly between the participants and is securely encrypted, so you can be sure that your call is completely private.

= Does it work on mobile devices? =

On mobile devices, Coviu works in the same browsers as on the desktop. Coviu also offers Android and iOS applications in which the video calls can be held. Contact support@coviu.com for more information.
